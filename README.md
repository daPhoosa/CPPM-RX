# CPPM-RX
Simple Arduino library for RC receivers that output CPPM

This is curerently configured for Orange Receivers from HobbyKing.
Testet with:
- R615X
- R616XN

### Usage:
 *	`StartCPPM(int)` -- Run once in setup.  Pass the Arduino interrupt number (not pin number)

 *	To Access pulse widths use the following:
 ```
RC_THROT
RC_AILER
RC_ELEV
RC_RUDD
RC_MODE
RC_AUX1
RC_AUX2
RC_AUX3
 ```
(See CPPM-RX.h to adjust pulse number if your receiver is different)

 * All channels report pulse length in micro seconds.  This will usually center on 1500us with ranges of 1000-2000us or 1100-1900us depending on receiver brand.
 *	`RX_Fail()` -- this function will return TRUE if last pulse was seen more than 0.5s ago
 *	`CPPM_display()`  -- this function will output the current pulse values to the default serial port.  Used for testing.
